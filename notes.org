* Parser
- Lvalues cannot be checked at parser level due to R-R conflict.
** TODO implement lvalue check
- change package paths to ~pack1::pack2::id~ from ~pack1.pack2::id~ to avoid ambiguity
  pack1.(pack2::id) or (pack1.pack2)::id
- misterious bug with NeoBeaver, switch to Beaver
- always check for undefined non-terminals; otherwise you'll get a mismatch between the ID expected by Beaver and the ID produced by Flex
