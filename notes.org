* Parser
- Lvalues cannot be checked at parser level due to R-R conflict.
** TODO implement lvalue check
- change package paths to ~pack1::pack2::id~ from ~pack1.pack2::id~ to avoid ambiguity
  pack1.(pack2::id) or (pack1.pack2)::id
- always check for undefined non-terminals; otherwise you'll get a mismatch between the ID expected by Beaver and the ID produced by Flex

* Name analysis
** Scopes
Function and method parameters live in a scope enclosing the body of the function. This means that they can be shadowed by variable declarations
inside the function.

** Name overloading
Name overloading is generally disabled. This simplifies name analysis.
Inside type declarations: formal type paramaters, formal constructor parameters, methods and member declarations share the same namespace.
Inside a translation unit (i.e. Program): function declarations, type declarations and variable declarations share the same namespace.
